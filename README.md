# Coffee Machine Program

## **Overview**

This project simulates the **logic and functionality of a vending machine** through a coffee machine program. It mimics how a vending machine operatesâ€”handling user input, processing payments, checking inventory, and dispensing drinks.

## **Features**

### **1. User Interaction**

- The program prompts users to select a drink, similar to a vending machine menu.
- Users can request a resource report or turn off the machine.

### **2. Inventory Management**

- The system tracks available resources (*water, milk, coffee*).
- Prevents drink preparation if ingredients are insufficient.

### **3. Payment Processing**

- Users insert virtual coins.
- The program calculates whether enough money has been provided.
- If overpaid, the machine returns change.

### **4. Transaction Handling**

- If payment is insufficient, the machine refunds the user.
- If successful, the cost is added to the machineâ€™s earnings.

### **5. Dispensing the Drink**

- Once a valid transaction is completed, the drink is "prepared," and resources are deducted.

## **Purpose of This Simulation**

- Demonstrates real-world **vending machine logic**.
- Helps understand **conditional statements, loops, functions, and user input handling** in programming.
- Provides a **practical exercise** in automation and cash handling.

## **How to Run the Program**

1. Run the script.
2. Select a drink from the menu (`espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`).
3. 'Insert' coins when prompted.
4. Receive your drink or a refund if the transaction fails.
5. Type `report` to view current resources.
6. Type `off` to shut down the machine.

A fun and practical way to pick up programming skills while building something useful! ðŸš€
